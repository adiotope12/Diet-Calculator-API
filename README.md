# Diet-Calculator-API

As a computer science major I've heard a lot about APIs, the only problem is that I don't know a lot about APIs. I decided to create an API in order to learn more about API usage and creation. I used Azure Web App Service and Azure API Management. This API is based off of a much smaller project I did to refresh my knowledge of C++ (https://github.com/adiotope12/Diet-Calculator). This project is similar however gives the user more information and stores the data in a Azure CosmosDB for later access. Here is an example with some of my information: https://topeadioapi.azure-api.net/Tope.

Base Url: https://topeadioapi.azure-api.net/

GET Request: Base Url/id

POST Request: Base Url/id/height(ex: 5.11,6.0)/weight/age/gender/Workouts Per Week

PUT Request: Base Url?params

DELETE Request: Base Url/id

What I love the most about this project was that I was able to take an old project and turn it into something new while also learning about new things.

Thanks,
Tope
